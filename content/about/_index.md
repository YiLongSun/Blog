Hey,

I'm Yi-Long Sun, and I'm a master's student at National Tsing Hua University ([NTHU](https://nthu-en.site.nthu.edu.tw/)) studying computer vision, data science, machine learning, and deep learning. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at National Taipei University of Technology ([NTUT](https://www-en.ntut.edu.tw/)), where I developed a strong foundation in programming and data analysis.

Throughout my academic journey, I discovered my passion for data science and machine learning, which led me to pursue advanced studies in these fields. My research focuses on developing innovative machine learning models to solve real-world problems, and I'm excited to share my knowledge and insights with you through this blog.

In this blog, I'll be discussing various topics related to data science, machine learning, and deep learning, including techniques, tools, and best practices. I hope you find my articles informative and engaging, and I look forward to connecting with you on this exciting journey. Thanks for joining me!
